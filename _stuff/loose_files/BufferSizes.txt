ADC
	Number of regular channels					5
	Size of each channel in bytes				2
	Sample frequency							400 Hz

SD Card
	Max time to process/write 100 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 200 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 300 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 400 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 500 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 750 bytes			
	Max time to process/write 1000 bytes		
	Max time to process/write 1500 bytes		
	Max time to process/write 2000 bytes

	Max time to process/write 3000 bytes		


	
1. How many bytes are acquired per second?

ADC = 400 * 5 * 2		= 4000 B/s
MPU = 400 * 4 * 3 * 2	= 4800 B/s
PPG = 400 * 4 * 1		= 1200 B/s
TOTAL					= 10000 B/s

2. How many bytes are acquired in a 200ms period?

ADC = 4000 / 5			= 800 B
MPU = 4800 / 5			= 960 B
PPG = 1200 / 5			= 240 B
TOTAL					= 2000 B
